UI Polish

Improve button sizing and spacing consistency

Check font readability on projector (classroom test)

Confirm responsive layout (small laptop / tablet)

Ensure legend works cleanly on mobile width

Remove any leftover console.log()

2️⃣ Code Cleanup

Remove unused imports / variables

Remove commented-out debug code

Make naming consistent (goal, mode, etc.)

Confirm character select works after rebuild

Confirm no hardcoded paths that break on build

Make sure no duplicate CSS rules remain

Run npm run build and check for warnings

Optional but strong portfolio move:

Add short comments explaining architecture (Board / Renderer / Goal system separation)

3️⃣ Functionality Check (Important)

Before publishing, test:

Level mode: goal never repeats twice

Free mode: no errors

Legend toggle: works open/close repeatedly

Confetti clears properly

Next button resets correctly

Character select persists into game

Menu → Game → Menu loop works cleanly

4️⃣ Build / Deployment

npm run build

Confirm /dist loads locally with a static server

Verify asset paths (icons, tiles) work in production

If using GitHub Pages, confirm correct base path

5️⃣ README Cleanup

Include:

Project purpose (classroom English directions practice)

Tech stack (Webpack, vanilla JS, modular structure)

Feature list

Screenshots

How to run locally

How it could expand (future roadmap)

Optional:

Short reflection section (what you learned)

6️⃣ Small Professional Touches (Often Forgotten)

Add favicon

Add proper <title> tag (already good)

Add alt text to images

Check for spelling consistency (Supermarket vs Shop etc.)

Confirm all Japanese text is correct (no awkward phrasing)

What You’re Missing Most Likely

You didn’t list:

Production path testing (very common break point)

Removing dev console logs

Screenshot for README

Version tagging (optional but nice)
