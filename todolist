2️⃣ Code Cleanup

Remove unused imports / variables
Remove commented-out debug code
Make naming consistent (goal, mode, etc.)
Confirm character select works after rebuild
Confirm no hardcoded paths that break on build
Make sure no duplicate CSS rules remain
Run npm run build and check for warnings
Add short comments explaining architecture (Board / Renderer / Goal system separation)

3Functionality Check (Important)
Before publishing, test:
Level mode: goal never repeats twice
Free mode: no errors
Legend toggle: works open/close repeatedly
Confetti clears properly
Next button resets correctly
Character select persists into game
Menu → Game → Menu loop works cleanly

4Build / Deployment
npm run build
Confirm /dist loads locally with a static server
Verify asset paths (icons, tiles) work in production
If using GitHub Pages, confirm correct base path

5 README C
Project purpose (classroom English directions practice)

- to teach module design to myself
  Tech stack (Webpack, vanilla JS, modular structure)
  Feature list
  How it could expand (future roadmap)
  Short reflection section (what you learned)
  Confirm all Japanese text is correct (no awkward phrasing)
  Screenshot for README
- mention references for images and files
