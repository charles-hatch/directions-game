# directions-game

This project is intended to help teach Japanese Elementary students learn English for directional words. The buttons are written in English, and when the project is complete, there will be a legend explaining various methods to employ this simple game in the browser. Students can use their tablets to quickly pull this up, and no doubt will enjoy the game. I plan on expanding it further to add:

- multiple levels or maps (up to 3)
- avatar selection
- a single player mode (where the program tells the student which location to go to)
- a legend to explain buttons and methods of play
