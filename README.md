# My Town – Directions Game

A browser-based ESL classroom game designed to help Japanese elementary students practice English directional language (left, right, straight, front).

The game runs entirely in the browser and is optimized for laptop and classroom display use.

---

## Overview

Students navigate a small town grid using English instruction buttons.

Two modes are available:

- **Free Mode** – Teacher-led or pair-based speaking practice.
- **Level Mode** – Goal-driven challenges where students navigate to a target building using correct directional phrases.

The focus is repetition of practical sentence patterns such as:

- “Turn left.”
- “Go straight.”
- “You can see it on your right.”

## Features

- Responsive scaling for classroom screens
- Randomized, non-repeating goals
- Avatar selection
- Visual goal panel
- Confetti feedback on correct answers
- Built-in vocabulary legend

---

## Technical Structure

The project follows a modular architecture separating:

- Game logic
- Rendering
- State management
- UI control

Board logic assigns abstract tile types, while the renderer maps them to visual assets, keeping logic independent from presentation.

---

## Purpose

Designed for real classroom use with minimal setup, clear UI, and repeatable speaking practice.

Future improvements may include additional maps, progression systems, and expanded vocabulary sets.
